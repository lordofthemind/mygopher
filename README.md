if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to load TLS certificate: %v", err)
}
```

### Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/gin-contrib/cors"
    "github.com/lordofthemind/mygopher/gophergin"
)

func main() {
    // Define server configuration
    serverConfig := gophergin.ServerConfig{
        Port:         8080,
        StaticPath:   "./static",
        TemplatePath: "./templates",
        UseTLS:       false,
        UseCORS:      true,
        CORSConfig: cors.Config{
            AllowOrigins: []string{"https://example.com"},
            AllowMethods: []string{"GET", "POST"},
        },
    }

    // Set up the server with CORS support
    router, err := (&gophergin.CorsServerSetup{}).SetUpServer(serverConfig)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to set up server: %v", err)
    }

    // Start the server
    if err := gophergin.StartGinServer(router, serverConfig); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to start server: %v", err)
    }

    // Gracefully shutdown on interrupt
    gophergin.GracefulShutdown(&http.Server{Addr: ":8080"})
}
```

### Notes
- **TLS Support**: To enable HTTPS, set `UseTLS` to `true` and provide valid paths for `TLSCertFile` and `TLSKeyFile`.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The `GracefulShutdown` function ensures that the server is terminated gracefully without abruptly closing active connections.
- **CORS Configuration**: The CORS settings can be customized via `CORSConfig` in `ServerConfig`.
